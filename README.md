""" Advanced File Integrity Checker using SHA-256

This script scans all files in a specified directory and calculates their SHA-256 hashes. It then compares each hash to a list of known (potentially malicious or sensitive) hashes provided in an external file. It provides memory usage tracking and alerts the user whenever a match is found.

This is useful for detecting known malicious files, verifying integrity, or scanning against virus signature hashes (e.g., from VirusShare).

Usage:
python integrity_checker.py <directory_to_scan> <known_hashes_file>
Example: python integrity_checker.py /home/user/documents/ /path/to/sha256_hash_list.txt

Dependencies:
None (pure Python standard library)
Tested with Python 3.9+ """
